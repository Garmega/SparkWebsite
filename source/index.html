                    <p class="lead text-justify">Spark is a student driven research initiative that is looking to arm teachers
                        with the knowledge and tools to teach high school students. The inspiration
                        from this project came from our personal experience and the difficulty
                        in finding a major in college. We all found our current major Informatics
                        eventually, but the time it took was much too long. We took a survey within
                        the major inquiring whether or not people would have liked to have been
                        introduced to Informatics or similar topics earlier. The answers was almost
                        uninimously yes and that the ideal time would have been during high school.
                        We examined high curriculums of nearby high schools and recognized that
                        they are devoid of classes that teach technical computer literacy and design
                        thinking.&nbsp;
