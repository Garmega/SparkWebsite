                    <p>
                        Spark is a student driven research initiative that is looking to arm teacherswith the knowledge and tools to teach high school students. The inspiration from this project came from our personal experience and the difficulty in finding a major in college. We all found our current major Informatics eventually, but the time it took was much too long. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We took a survey within the major inquiring whether or not people would have liked to have been introduced to Informatics or similar topics earlier. The answers was almost uninimously yes and that the ideal time would have been during high school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We examined high curriculums of nearby high schools and recognized that they are devoid of classes that teach technical computer literacy and design thinking.
