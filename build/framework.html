                                        <p> <em>Our Experience</em></p>
                                        <p> This is something we never really had to do, we conducted a survey that asked if students in our major would have wanted to discover our major sooner and (Some percentage) said yes. We were working from the assumption that the students at these high schools would have some interest in the program or subjects of Informatics. If they did not then we could spark an interest in them. However this is relevant for a high school administrator because there is much less motivation to bring a program like this to their school if their students have little to no interest. </p>
                                        <p> <em>Recommendation</em></p>
                                        <p> Gather the student’s interest through an easy to fill out survey. Marking down even the slightest interest in the subject matter as a yes, because the program is meant to foster and nurture interest.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Next get in contact with administrators at a local University</p>
                                        <p> <em>Our Experience</em></p>
                                        <p> For our team it was easy as walking down the hall to talk to our administrative staff. This is not something that will be reflected in the experience of many high school administrators.</p>
                                        <p> <em>Recommendation</em></p>
                                        <p> Call to make a personal connection with the higher education administrator in the program you are interested in making the connection with. Then just talk to them about a program like Spark. Ask the Higher Education Admins numbers on interested college students to come and teach. Ask the college admin about times the College students can come. Then set meeting times.</p>

                                        <p> <em>Our Experience</em></p>
                                        <p> We never had to do this, because we were interested in teaching. However we spoke we quite a few of our peers and their interest was nearly unanimous.</p>
                                        <p> <em>Recommendation</em></p>
                                        <p> Make an easy five question survey to gauge interest: What is your name? Would you like to go to high schools and teach about (insert program/ major name here) ? How many hours would you be available per week? What times would you be available? Demographic Section</p>

                                        <p>Contact Local High School Administrators</p>
                                        <p> <em>Our Experience</em></p>
                                        <p> This was particularly easy for us, because we just graduated high school not long ago and still felt affiliated with the schools that we contacted. However we contacted two high schools which none of the team attended and received positive feedback, there was only one out of the four schools contacted that responded negatively. We simply emailed principals and other school board administrators asking if we could come in to teach about Informatics. The demand for college students coming back was so incredibly high, we could not meet it. </p>
                                        <p> <em>Recommendation</em></p>
                                        <p> Either call or email local administrators with the information about the number of college students interested in the program and ask if they would like to participate in a program like this. Ask them to find out if their students are interested and get back to you.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>(Assuming a positive response from at least one high school) Start Curriculum Building</p>

                                        <p> <em>Our Experience</em></p>
                                        <p> This is not something we had to do, because we just fit our schedules around the pilot classes at each high school. However a quick survey is an easy way to get time availabilities for a wide number of people.</p>
                                        <p> <em>Recommendation</em></p>
                                        <p> Make a quick survey asking: What is your name? (Probably necessary if you want to pick specific students for the program) What days are you available? What times on each day are you available on?</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                        <p> <em>Our Experience</em></p>
                                        <p> We went through an odyssey learning from different professors that we thought taught well and other education veterans, at the different high schools. </p>
                                        <p> <em>Recommendation</em></p>
                                        <p> To ease this process of trying to figure out how to teach make a committee of qualified professors to help teach your students how to teach properly. In addition including some of the high school teachers and principals will allow the allow the students to get better perspectives on how messages and curriculums should be tailored to each high school. As the years progress this type of committee can be handed over to students who are veterans in the program.</p>

                                    <li>
                                        <p>(Assuming Positive Response From Both) Find a group of professors and high school admins to consult</p>
                                        <p> <em>Our experience</em></p>
                                        <p> We just had to email people we knew and professors that we knew to be good at their jobs. We then would meet with each professor/ high school admin/ higher ed admin and learn what we wanted. </p>
                                        <p> <em>Recommendation</em></p>
                                        <p> If you have a child at a high school try to get them to help recruit teachers. If you have a child in college have them recruit professors/ admin otherwise you will likely have to cold call these people. You want to use these people to help you build curriculums and you need them to gauge student interest.</p>

                    <p>
                        Spark is a student driven research initiative that is looking to arm teacherswith the knowledge and tools to teach high school students. The inspiration from this project came from our personal experience and the difficulty in finding a major in college. We all found our current major Informatics eventually, but the time it took was much too long. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We took a survey within the major inquiring whether or not people would have liked to have been introduced to Informatics or similar topics earlier. The answers was almost uninimously yes and that the ideal time would have been during high school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We examined high curriculums of nearby high schools and recognized that they are devoid of classes that teach technical computer literacy and design thinking.
